//Types of Numbers
// Integers are whole numbers, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.
// Floating point numbers (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.
// Doubles are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).
// We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also have things like:
//
// Binary — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.
// Octal — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.
// Hexadecimal — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting colors in CSS.

//Examples
let sum = 6 + 9
let diff = 9 - 6
let product = 6 * 9
let quotient = 9/6
let remainder = 9%6
let expo = 6 ** 9

//increment
let guessCount = 0
guessCount++;

//decrement
